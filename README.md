# Live Project

## Overview
My last major project in The Tech Academy Software Development bootcamp involved building a content management service (CMS) website for a local theatre/acting company. The project is built using an ASP/.NET MVC and Entity Framework. The goal was to create a website that allowed easy management of the website display, login capabilities, and past performance and performer wikis. The website also allows for the theatre to rent out space or equipment. This includes rental requests, rental and equipment rooms, and post-rental surveys.

The 2 weeks of my Live Project (referred to as "Theatre Project" onward) involved working in the rental area portion of the website, with opportunities to be involved in both back-end and front-end stories. I first created a Rental History entity model and CRUD pages, My subsequent work featured client-specific styling and functionality for the Index and Create pages. 

## Story 1: Set-up
I first created an entity model for the Rental History class in order to include the information in the Theatre Project database. I subsequently used Entity Framework to get the CRUD pages started. 

## Story 2: Sytling Index and Create pages
The second story involved styling the Index and Create pages using a client-specific colour palette and layout. Based on the limited instructions, I was able to re-create ![this](~/Desktop/CreateRental.gif).
